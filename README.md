# Weather-API-app
This Python script retrieves weather data from OpenWeatherMap API based on a user input. The retrieved data is stored in a JSON file and parsed to extract weather information for the city such as description and temperature. The script then creates a SQLite database and inserts the extracted data into a table named weather. The data can then be retrieved and analyzed for further use. Additionally, a notification is displayed on Windows 11 using the win11toast module that provides information about the weather in the selected city.

This script demonstrates how to fetch data from an API, parse JSON data, and store it in a database. It also shows how to use external modules to display notifications on Windows 11. It could be extended to include more features like displaying a weather forecast or creating a graphical user interface to display the data in a more user-friendly way.
