# Game of thrones API
This Python code interacts with the "Game of Thrones" API to retrieve information about a character. It prompts the user to enter a character's name and sends a request to the API. If the character is found, the code saves the response as a JSON file and extracts relevant details such as the character's name, birth information, aliases, and actor. It then establishes a connection to an SQLite database, creates a table and inserts the character's information into the table. Finally, a toast notification is displayed on Windows 11, showing the character's name, birth details, and the actor who portrayed them.
